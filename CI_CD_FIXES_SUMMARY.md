## Overview

This document summarizes the CI/CD issues identified and resolved for the
Auterity Unified Platform, including GitHub Actions workflows and Vercel
deployment configuration.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Vercel Configuration

- **Issue**: No Vercel configuration files were present in the repository
- **Impact**: Unable to deploy to Vercel platform
- **Resolution**: Created comprehensive Vercel configuration

### 2. Workflow File Organization

- **Issue**: Multiple disabled workflow files causing confusion
- **Impact**: Unclear which workflows are active
- **Resolution**: Identified active workflows and created new deployment workflows

### 3. Missing Deployment Workflows

- **Issue**: No dedicated Vercel deployment workflows configured
- **Impact**: Manual deployment process required
- **Resolution**: Created automated preview and production deployment workflows

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Vercel Configuration (`/vercel.json`)

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm ci",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false,
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/:path*",
      "destination": "http://localhost:5055/api/:path*"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Features:**

- Configured for Vite framework
- Proper build and output directory settings
- Clean URLs enabled
- Security headers included
- API proxy configuration

### 2. Vercel Production Deployment Workflow

- Triggers on push to main branch
- Uses Vercel CLI for deployment
- Includes environment variable configuration
- Provides deployment notifications

### 3. Vercel Preview Deployment Workflow

- Triggers on pull requests
- Creates preview deployments
- Automatically comments PR with preview URL
- Updates preview on new commits

## Required Secrets Configuration

To complete the CI/CD setup, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. **VERCEL_TOKEN**: Your Vercel authentication token
   - Get it from: <https://vercel.com/account/tokens>

1. **VERCEL_ORG_ID**: Your Vercel organization ID
   - Run `vercel whoami` to get your org ID

1. **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**: Your Vercel project ID
   - Run `vercel link` in your project root to create/link project

### How to Add Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
1. Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
1. Click "New repository secret"
1. Add each secret with the corresponding value

## Active Workflows Status

### Currently Active Workflows

1. **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Runs tests and build verification
   - Triggers on push/PR to main

1. **Vercel Production** (`.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml`)
   - Deploys to production on main branch
   - Requires secrets configuration

1. **Vercel Preview** (`.github/workflows/vercel-preview.yml`)
   - Creates preview deployments for PRs
   - Requires secrets configuration

## Build Script Verification

### Frontend Build Configuration

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest run --config vitest.config.ts"
  }
}
```

### Backend Build Configuration

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:backend": "cd backend && python -m py_compile app/main.py"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Link Vercel Project**:

   ```bash
   npx vercel link
   ```

1. **Configure Secrets**:
   - Add the three required secrets to GitHub repository

1. **Test Deployment**:

   ```bash
   npx vercel --prod
   ```

1. **Monitor Workflows**:
   - Check Actions tab for workflow runs
   - Review deployment logs in Vercel dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Workflow not triggering**:
   - Ensure branch protection rules allow workflow runs
   - Check workflow file syntax
   - Verify secrets are properly configured

1. **Build failures**:
   - Check Node.js version compatibility (requires v20+)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Review build logs for specific errors

1. **Deployment failures**:
   - Confirm Vercel token is valid
   - Check project linking status
   - Verify build output directory matches configuration

## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented Optimizations

1. **Parallel job execution** in CI pipeline
1. **Intelligent caching** for dependencies
1. **Conditional workflow execution** based on file changes
1. **Concurrent test execution** for faster feedback

### Workflow Execution Times (Expected)

- Code Quality: ~2-3 minutes
- Frontend Tests: ~3-4 minutes
- Backend Tests: ~2-3 minutes
- Security Scan: ~2-3 minutes
- Deployment: ~2-3 minutes

## Security Considerations

1. **Secrets Management**:
   - All sensitive data stored as GitHub secrets
   - No hardcoded credentials in workflows
   - Token rotation recommended every 90 days

1. **Workflow Permissions**:
   - Minimal required permissions set
   - Read-only access where possible
   - Write permissions only for necessary operations

1. **Branch Protection**:
   - Recommend enabling branch protection for main
   - Require PR reviews before merge
   - Enable status checks for CI workflows

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Recommended Monitoring Setup

1. **GitHub Actions Notifications**:
   - Enable email notifications for failed workflows
   - Set up Slack integration for team alerts

1. **Vercel Deployment Monitoring**:
   - Monitor deployment success rates
   - Set up alerts for failed deployments
   - Track performance metrics

## Conclusion

The CI/CD pipeline is now configured with:

- ✅ Automated testing and build verification
- ✅ Production deployment to Vercel
- ✅ Preview deployments for pull requests
- ✅ Proper secrets management
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ Performance optimizations

All workflows are ready for use once the required secrets are configured
in the GitHub repository settings.
