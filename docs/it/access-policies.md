# Access Control & Permissioning Policies

## Overview

This document defines Auterity's access control and permissioning policies, ensuring that users have appropriate access to systems and data based on their roles and responsibilities. These policies implement the principle of least privilege while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Access Control Framework

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Core Principles
- **Role-based permissions**: Access rights are assigned based on user roles
- **Least privilege**: Users receive minimum permissions required for their duties
- **Separation of duties**: Critical functions require multiple approvals
- **Regular reviews**: Access rights are reviewed and updated regularly

#### User Roles

##### 1. System Administrator
```typescript
interface SystemAdministratorRole {
  permissions: {
    // Full system access
    system_management: "full";
    user_management: "full";
    security_configuration: "full";
    audit_logs: "full";
    
    // Data access
    all_data: "read_write";
    sensitive_data: "read_write";
    
    // Emergency access
    emergency_override: true;
    bypass_approvals: true;
  };
  
  restrictions: {
    // Cannot modify audit logs
    audit_log_modification: "denied";
    // Cannot access other admin sessions
    session_hijacking: "denied";
  };
  
  approval_requirements: {
    // Requires dual authorization for critical changes
    critical_changes: "dual_approval";
    // Requires executive approval for policy changes
    policy_changes: "executive_approval";
  };
}
```

##### 2. Organization Administrator
```typescript
interface OrganizationAdministratorRole {
  permissions: {
    // Organization-level management
    org_users: "manage";
    org_workflows: "manage";
    org_templates: "manage";
    org_analytics: "read";
    
    // Billing and subscriptions
    billing_management: "manage";
    subscription_management: "manage";
    
    // Limited system access
    system_health: "read";
    support_tickets: "create";
  };
  
  restrictions: {
    // Cannot access other organizations
    cross_org_access: "denied";
    // Cannot modify system settings
    system_configuration: "denied";
    // Cannot access audit logs
    audit_logs: "denied";
  };
  
  approval_requirements: {
    // Requires approval for user deletions
    user_deletion: "manager_approval";
    // Requires approval for billing changes
    billing_changes: "financial_approval";
  };
}
```

##### 3. Workflow Manager
```typescript
interface WorkflowManagerRole {
  permissions: {
    // Workflow management
    workflows: "create_edit_delete";
    workflow_templates: "create_edit";
    workflow_execution: "manage";
    
    // Team collaboration
    team_members: "manage";
    collaboration_sessions: "manage";
    
    // Analytics and reporting
    workflow_analytics: "read";
    performance_reports: "read";
    team_reports: "read";
  };
  
  restrictions: {
    // Cannot access organization settings
    org_settings: "denied";
    // Cannot manage billing
    billing_access: "denied";
    // Cannot access other teams' workflows
    cross_team_access: "denied";
  };
  
  approval_requirements: {
    // Requires approval for workflow deletions
    workflow_deletion: "team_lead_approval";
    // Requires approval for template publishing
    template_publishing: "reviewer_approval";
  };
}
```

##### 4. Workflow User
```typescript
interface WorkflowUserRole {
  permissions: {
    // Basic workflow access
    assigned_workflows: "execute";
    workflow_templates: "use";
    
    // Personal workspace
    personal_workflows: "create_edit";
    personal_templates: "create";
    
    // Collaboration
    team_workflows: "read_comment";
    collaboration_sessions: "participate";
    
    // Limited analytics
    personal_analytics: "read";
    workflow_history: "read";
  };
  
  restrictions: {
    // Cannot delete workflows
    workflow_deletion: "denied";
    // Cannot manage users
    user_management: "denied";
    // Cannot access billing
    billing_access: "denied";
    // Cannot publish templates
    template_publishing: "denied";
  };
  
  approval_requirements: {
    // Requires approval for workflow sharing
    workflow_sharing: "manager_approval";
  };
}
```

##### 5. Read-Only User
```typescript
interface ReadOnlyUserRole {
  permissions: {
    // View-only access
    workflows: "read";
    workflow_templates: "read";
    analytics: "read";
    reports: "read";
    
    // Limited collaboration
    collaboration_sessions: "observe";
    comments: "read";
  };
  
  restrictions: {
    // Cannot modify anything
    create_edit_delete: "denied";
    // Cannot execute workflows
    workflow_execution: "denied";
    // Cannot participate in collaboration
    active_collaboration: "denied";
  };
  
  approval_requirements: {
    // No approvals required
    all_actions: "none";
  };
}
```

### 2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

#### Policy Structure
```typescript
interface ABACPolicy {
  subject: {
    user_id: string;
    roles: string[];
    department: string;
    clearance_level: string;
    location: string;
  };
  
  resource: {
    type: string;
    owner: string;
    classification: string;
    tags: string[];
    created_date: Date;
  };
  
  action: string;
  
  environment: {
    time_of_day: string;
    location: string;
    device_type: string;
    network_type: string;
  };
  
  conditions: string[];
}

// Example Policies
const confidentialDataPolicy: ABACPolicy = {
  subject: { clearance_level: "confidential" },
  resource: { classification: "confidential" },
  action: "read",
  environment: { network_type: "corporate" },
  conditions: [
    "subject.clearance_level >= resource.classification",
    "environment.network_type == 'corporate'",
    "subject.department == resource.owner_department"
  ]
};
```

## User Lifecycle Management

### 1. User Onboarding

#### Provisioning Process
```yaml

  steps:
    1. User account creation:
       - Email verification
       - Initial password setup
       - Basic profile information
       
    2. Role assignment:
       - Business role identification
       - System role mapping
       - Permission assignment
       - Approval workflow
       
    3. Access setup:
       - Application access
       - System permissions
       - Resource allocation
       - Training assignments
       
    4. Verification:
