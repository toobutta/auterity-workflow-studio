## Step 2: Understanding Core Concepts

### 2.1 Workflows

A **workflow** is an automated process that handles tasks in your dealership. Think of it as a recipe for automation.

**Key Components:**
- **Nodes**: Individual steps in your workflow (AI processing, data transformation, etc.)
- **Connections**: Links between nodes that define the flow
- **Triggers**: Events that start the workflow
- **Variables**: Data that flows between steps

### 2.2 Templates

**Templates** are pre-built workflows for common dealership scenarios:

| Template Category | Use Cases |
|-------------------|-----------|
| **Service** | Appointment scheduling, customer notifications |
| **Sales** | Lead qualification, follow-up automation |
| **Parts** | Inventory management, supplier communication |
| **Administrative** | Document processing, compliance tracking |

### 2.3 AI Integration

Auterity includes **AI-powered nodes** that can:
- Extract information from documents
- Generate customer communications
- Analyze images and photos
- Make intelligent decisions
- Process natural language
