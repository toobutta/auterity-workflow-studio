   Output: JSON with complexity score and task type
   ```

3. **Add Model Selection Logic**
   ```
   Node Type: Logic → Decision Split
   Conditions:
   - Complexity > 8 → GPT-4
   - Complexity 5-8 → Claude-3
   - Complexity < 5 → GPT-3.5 Turbo
   - Safety-critical → Claude-3 (override)
   ```

4. **Add Model Execution Nodes**
   ```
   For each model path:
   - GPT-4 Node: High-complexity processing
   - Claude-3 Node: Safe, analytical processing
   - GPT-3.5 Node: Fast, routine processing
   ```

### 2.2 Implement Cost Optimization

1. **Add Cost Tracking**
   ```
   Node Type: Analytics → Cost Tracker
   Track: Token usage, API calls, processing time
   Thresholds: Set budget limits per workflow
   ```

2. **Add Fallback Logic**
   ```
   If expensive model fails → Retry with cheaper model
   If cost exceeds budget → Use cached responses
   If processing timeout → Simplify prompt and retry
   ```

---

## Step 3: Advanced Prompt Engineering

### 3.1 Create Dynamic Prompts

1. **Add Prompt Builder Node**
   ```
   Node Type: Data → Text Formatter
   Purpose: Create context-aware prompts
   Variables: Customer data, task type, urgency level
   ```

2. **Implement Context Injection**
   ```
   Template: "You are a [Role] at [Dealership Name].
   Customer: [Customer Name] from [Location]
   Task: [Specific Task Description]
   Context: [Relevant Customer History]
   Requirements: [Specific Output Format]
   Constraints: [Business Rules, Compliance]"
   ```

### 3.2 Prompt Optimization Techniques

#### Chain of Thought Prompting
```
"You are an expert service advisor. Think step-by-step:

1. Analyze the customer's service history
2. Identify patterns in their vehicle issues
3. Consider seasonal factors and mileage
4. Recommend appropriate service schedule
5. Explain reasoning clearly to customer

Customer Data: [Insert customer information]
Output Format: JSON with recommendation and explanation"
```

#### Few-Shot Learning
```
"Examples of excellent customer emails:

Example 1:
Input: Customer complaining about wait time
Output: "I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience..."

Example 2:
Input: Customer requesting service quote
Output: "I'd be happy to provide a detailed quote..."

Now, generate a response for:
Input: [Customer Message]
Output: [Professional Response]"
```

#### Structured Output Prompts
```
"Analyze this customer service request and provide:

SERVICE_ANALYSIS: {
  "urgency_level": "high|medium|low",
  "service_type": "maintenance|repair|diagnostic",
  "estimated_duration": "X hours",
  "parts_required": ["part1", "part2"],
  "technician_skill_level": "1-5"
}

CUSTOMER_RESPONSE: {
  "tone": "professional|friendly|urgent",
  "key_points": ["point1", "point2"],
  "next_steps": ["step1", "step2"],
  "follow_up_timeline": "X hours/days"
}

Input: [Service Request Text]"
```

---

## Step 4: Intelligent Decision Making

### 4.1 Add AI-Powered Decisions

1. **Create Decision Analysis Node**
   ```
   Node Type: AI Processing → Decision Analysis
   Model: Claude-3 (for reliable decision making)
   Input: Multiple data sources (customer history, service data, business rules)
   Output: Structured decision with confidence score
   ```

2. **Implement Confidence Scoring**
   ```
   Decision Output Format:
   {
     "decision": "approve|deny|escalate",
     "confidence_score": 0.85,
     "reasoning": "Detailed explanation",
     "risk_factors": ["factor1", "factor2"],
     "recommendations": ["action1", "action2"]
   }
   ```

### 4.2 Add Human-in-the-Loop

1. **Add Approval Gateway**
   ```
   Node Type: Logic → Approval Gateway
   Conditions:
   - High confidence (>0.9) → Auto-approve
   - Medium confidence (0.7-0.9) → Manager review
   - Low confidence (<0.7) → Supervisor review
   ```

2. **Implement Escalation Logic**
   ```
   Escalation Rules:
   - Amount > $5000 → Manager approval
   - Rush service → Supervisor approval
   - VIP customer → Expedited review
   - Safety concern → Immediate supervisor notification
   ```

---

## Step 5: Error Handling & Resilience

### 5.1 AI-Specific Error Handling

1. **Add AI Error Detection**
   ```
   Node Type: Logic → Error Detector
   Detect: Model timeouts, API failures, invalid responses
   Actions: Retry, fallback model, human intervention
   ```

2. **Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   ```
   Circuit Breaker Logic:
   - Success threshold: 95% success rate
   - Failure threshold: 5 consecutive failures
   - Recovery timeout: 5 minutes
   - Half-open state: Test with single request
   ```

### 5.2 Fallback Mechanisms

1. **Model Fallback Chain**
   ```
   Primary: GPT-4
   ↓ (if fails)
   Secondary: Claude-3
   ↓ (if fails)
   Tertiary: GPT-3.5 Turbo
   ↓ (if fails)
   Final: Cached/Template Response
   ```

2. **Response Validation**
   ```
   Validation Rules:
   - Response format matches expected schema
   - Required fields are present
   - Values are within acceptable ranges
   - No sensitive data leakage
   - Compliance with business rules
   ```

---

## Step 6: Performance Optimization

### 6.1 Caching Strategies

1. **Add Response Caching**
   ```
   Node Type: Data → Cache Manager
   Cache Key: Hash of input parameters
   TTL: 24 hours for similar requests
   Invalidation: Manual or time-based
   ```

2. **Implement Smart Caching**
   ```
   Cache Decision Logic:
   - Frequently requested data → Cache aggressively
   - Time-sensitive data → Short TTL
   - Personal data → No caching
   - Large responses → Compress before caching
   ```

### 6.2 Batch Processing

1. **Add Batch Processor**
   ```
   Node Type: Data → Batch Processor
   Batch Size: 10-50 items (model-dependent)
   Processing: Parallel execution
   Error Handling: Individual item failure doesn't stop batch
   ```

2. **Optimize for Cost**
   ```
   Cost Optimization:
   - Batch similar requests together
   - Use appropriate model for task complexity
   - Cache frequent responses
   - Monitor usage patterns
   ```
